Web of Trust Overlay
====================

This is an (unfinished prototype) browser extension that adds Web of
Trust-based indicators for identifying accounts that are definitely human and
not bots. It has integrations with sites (currently HN and Twitter) to find
usernames on the page, and adds an icon next to each username to indicate
whether it's a human or a bot. In the future, this will be based on a Web of
Trust model, where you can publicly vouch for accounts. At present, on the
other hand, this has no backend at all, so you can vouch/report accounts to
demo the UI, but this will be immediately forgotten and not set anywhere.

To run it (in development mode):
 * cd into `browserExtension`, run `yarn install` and `yarn watch`. Note that
   while `yarn watch` will rebuild automatically, you will still need to
   prompt Chrome to refresh the extension.
 * Add the extension to Chrome by going to chrome://extensions, clicking "Load
   unpacked", and adding browserExtension/build as an unpacked extension.
