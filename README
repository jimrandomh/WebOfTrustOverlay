Web of Trust Overlay
====================

This is an (unfinished prototype) browser extension that adds Web of
Trust-based indicators for identifying accounts that are definitely human and
not bots.

To run it (in development mode):
 * cd into `browserExtension`, run `yarn install` and `yarn watch`. Note that
   while `yarn watch` will rebuild automatically, you will still need to
   prompt Chrome to refresh the extension.
 * Add the extension to Chrome by going to chrome://extensions, clicking "Load
   unpacked", and adding browserExtension/build as an unpacked extension.
